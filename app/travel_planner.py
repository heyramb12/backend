    - SPECIFIC local restaurants with names (e.g., "Trishna Restaurant for seafood")
    - SPECIFIC shopping locations with names (e.g., "Colaba Causeway Market")
    - SPECIFIC cultural events or experiences with names when possible

    3. For each day:
    - Provide a morning, afternoon, and evening breakdown
    - List SPECIFIC places to visit with brief descriptions
    - Include estimated time spent at each location
    - Suggest specific local food options for each meal
    - Include transportation recommendations between locations

    4. For accommodation:
    - Use database information on hotels when available
    - Augment with web search to provide SPECIFIC hotel recommendations with names
    - Include brief descriptions of amenities and approximate pricing
    - Recommend specific room types based on the traveler's needs

    5. For transportation:
    - Provide SPECIFIC transportation options with names (e.g., "Uber", "Mumbai Metro", "BEST Bus routes")
    - Include estimated costs for transportation

    6. Practical Tips:
    - Include weather considerations for the time of year
    - Mention any local customs or etiquette important for travelers
    - Include safety tips specific to the destination
    - Suggest specific local phrases that might be helpful

    Remember:
    - ALWAYS provide SPECIFIC NAMED locations, not generic descriptions
    - Use the database information where available but greatly augment with web search
    - Format the response as a detailed, day-by-day itinerary
    - Don't mention that you're using database information in your response
    - If information is limited, use web search to fill in the gaps comprehensively
    - Make real-world, actionable recommendations with specific place names throughout
